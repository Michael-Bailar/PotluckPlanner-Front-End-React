# Potluck Planner - Front-End-React
This is the front end for an app I build with a team at Lambda School. I worked on the front end with a more advanced react person who set up the state management and designed the basic structure of the front end. My direct team mate was at the same stage of learning as me and we build out all the components and styled them. We worked very closely with the team lead who was responsible for approving our pull requests. It was a really good chance to get some practice with everything we learned from Lambda on React. It was also nice to try out Bootstrap/Reactstrap. I was surprised how easy it was to pick up and learn.

# Description
Basically, the potluck planner app is designed to make it easier to plan potlucks. You can go on the app and create an event then list the items you want brought to the potluck. People who are invited to the event can sign up to bring different food items. 

The app was built using React/Redux. We were sent endpoints to hit with requests so all we had to do was build out the front end and style it. Most of our time (Monday - Wednesday) was spent on building the structure of the app and we styled it up on thursday trying to match the visuals of the UI student who made a really nice landing page.

# Tech Used
Javascript, React/Redux, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap/Reactstrap, Node/Express.js (on the back end)
